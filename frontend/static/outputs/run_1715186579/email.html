            <p><p>Dear Mark Morrison,</p>

<p>I hope you're doing well. I'm thrilled to share a pivotal development at Uber that could redefine our collaborative marketing strategies.</p>

<p>Our partnership with Instacart introduces an innovative restaurant delivery service, specifically designed to cater to suburban families. This strategic move not only diversifies our offerings but also fortifies our competitive edge, particularly against DoorDash.</p>

<p>Despite facing some challenges in our Q2 forecast, our commitment to market leadership and innovation remains unwavering. These initiatives are testament to our dedication towards enhancing customer experiences and driving growth.</p>

<p>Let's explore how we can seamlessly incorporate these advancements into HubSpot's strategy, fostering mutual advancement.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br>May Zisbrod<br>mayzisbrod@gmail.com</p></p>
