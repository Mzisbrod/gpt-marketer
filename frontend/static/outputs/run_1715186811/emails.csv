Model Adwoa Aboah announced her pregnancy in a custom, flame-red bubble skirt and ruffle bolo by H&M. PVH Corp-owned Tommy Hilfiger, known for its mid-priced (and often discounted) slacks and sportswear, dressed K-Pop band Stray Kids for their first appearance on the Met steps, and in doing so, generated more conversation online than any brand on the carpet during the red carpet according to social media analytics firm Brandwatch.
