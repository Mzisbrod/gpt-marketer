According to some reports, Samsung is ready to follow the example of a competitor by adopting one of the technologies used in the packaging of HBM3 and HBM3E chips in order to gain the favor of Nvidia and increase the supply of its products for the needs of this client.  In addition, on the SK hynix assembly line, the yield level of suitable HBM3 chips fluctuates between 60–70%, according to some experts, while at Samsung it barely reaches 10–20%, so the latter is interested in improving the production technology of memory chips of this type. Like SK hynix, Samsung is already capable of creating 12-tier HBM3E stacks, but is the first to use partial mold-fill (MUF) mass reflow technology to create insulating layers between memory dies in a stack as of 2021, whereas Samsung has so far relied on the use of thermocompression non-conductive film (NCF), which provides worse heat dissipation conditions.
