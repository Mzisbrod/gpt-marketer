The first ASML lithography scanner was installed to produce 2nm chips using Low-NA EUV technology Somewhat overlooked in the context of recent advances between Intel and ASML is the fact that chipmakers hope to master 2nm production without switching to the use of more expensive EUV high-numerical aperture (High-NA) scanners. It is expected that this scanner will be able to process about 220 silicon wafers per hour versus the previous 160 pieces, justifying its high price with adequate performance, because the equipment for EUV lithography of the previous generation, to put it mildly, was not very fast.  This equipment, according to AnandTechis characterized by a Low Numerical Aperture (Low-NA) value of 0.33, but compared to the previous generation of ASML lithography scanners, it offers increased productivity and a more reasonable cost compared to high NA scanners.
